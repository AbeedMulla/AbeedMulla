Custom HTTP Server & Reverse Proxy
A from-scratch HTTP server + reverse proxy built using only Node.js raw TCP sockets (no frameworks, no http module). Implements manual HTTP parsing, request forwarding, and round-robin load balancing across multiple backend instances.

- Custom HTTP request/response parsing over TCP
- Reverse proxy that forwards /api/* to backend services
- Round-robin load balancing and basic health handling
- Logging and request timing for observability
